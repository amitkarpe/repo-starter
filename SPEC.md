# Specification

Status: DRAFT
Context: `<PERSONAL | WORK>`
Environment: `<LOCAL | LAB | DEV | NONPROD | PROD>`

## Objective

Describe the problem and intended result.

## Outcome

Describe the usable milestone/release package to deliver.

## Authorized

List the actions that may proceed without repeated approval while this SPEC is ACTIVE and the owning Issue/instruction remains in scope.

For `PERSONAL` + `LAB`/`DEV`, explicitly authorized deterministic work may include repo-owned implementation, deployment, cloud resource creation/mutation, validation, reset, and cleanup without asking resource-by-resource.

For `WORK` and especially `PROD`, grant only the bounded authority actually intended. Read-only investigation may be standing authority when explicitly stated; mutation requires proportionate approval in this SPEC or the current user instruction.

Repository visibility is not an authority signal. Private does not mean personal; public does not mean unrestricted.

## Autonomous Operating Contract

Once this SPEC is ACTIVE and the owning intent/Issue is accepted, execute
approved milestones continuously: discover -> implement -> focused validation
-> one cohesive PR -> safe normal merge -> evidence -> continue. Do not ask
the owner to approve each routine change, retry of a harmless local check,
or already-authorized LAB/DEV operation. For long tasks, record durable
execution IDs and reconcile the existing execution before attempting a retry.

**Host capability:** When an MCP or previous session is absent, verify
task-relevant host guidance and installed/authenticated `gh`, `glab`, or
`aws` CLI before claiming access is unavailable. Verify the exact repository,
environment, role and intended operation separately; authentication alone
does not authorize the mutation.

**Past-success recovery:** On a genuinely unfamiliar blocker with evidence
of previous success, search only the owning Issue/PR and current source first,
then the relevant non-secret evidence index or Codex summary. Record the
verified resolution in existing documentation, not a competing memory file.

**Escalation:** Exhaust useful work within scope, then report one specific
external owner decision with evidence. Never self-approve credentials,
persistent secret storage, PROD, destructive changes, public exposure,
broad IAM, unbounded cost or unsafe duplicate executions.

## MUST

- List required behavior and acceptance-critical invariants.

## MUST NOT

- List hard scope, security, data, publication, production, destructive, or cost boundaries.

## Phases / Milestones

Group related work into a cohesive useful package, normally several tightly coupled tasks or 2-3 phases sharing one outcome and trust boundary.

- Phase 1: `<outcome>`
- Phase 2: `<outcome>`
- Phase 3: `<outcome>`

Do not stop between routine approved phases merely to request permission again.

## Verification

State the smallest meaningful proof: focused tests/checks, runtime/provider readback, user-path validation, and cleanup/retention state when applicable.

## Stop Gates

Stop and ask only when required by a real boundary, for example:

- target repository/account/environment does not match the approved scope;
- work would enter PROD or another higher-risk environment without authority;
- destructive/non-recoverable data loss, credential/secret mutation, public exposure, or material cost is not explicitly approved;
- implementation would materially widen architecture, security/trust boundary, or external integration beyond the milestone;
- required validation fails or current state is ambiguous/unsafe.

Technical failure remains a blocker even when mutation is otherwise authorized.

## Acceptance

List concise conditions that make the whole milestone reviewable and complete.
